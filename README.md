# Generate-Synthetic-Images-with-DCGANs-in-Keras
**Course Objectives**
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

Understand Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs and GANs)
Design and train DCGANs using the Keras API in Python
By the end of this course, you will be able to build and train a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with Keras to generate images of fashionable clothes.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

**Course Overview**: This introductory reading material.
Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

**Graded Quiz**: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

Project Structure
The hands on project on Generating Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Kerasis divided into following tasks:

**Task 1:** Project Overview and Import Libraries

**Task 2:** Load and Preprocess the Data

**Task 3:** Create Batches of Training Data

**Task 4:** Build the Generator Network for DCGAN

**Task 5:** Build the Discriminator Network for DCGAN

**Task 6:** Compile the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)

**Task 7:** Define the Training Procedure

**Task 8:** Train DCGAN

**Task 9:** Generate Synthetic Images with DCGAN
